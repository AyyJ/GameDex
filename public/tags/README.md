# /public/tags Folder
This folder contains supporting media for the index.html page. This was created for homework 2 where we created HTML files for our rendered wireframes. All tags we did not use in our wireframes, we were to create a page that utilized all of the tags in the HTML5 specification.
We completed this by having a single page, seperated by sections for each section of the spec.
