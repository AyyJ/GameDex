# /public/wireframes Folder
This folder contains the rendered wireframes from homework one, actually implemented in HTML. This was part of homework 2 asking only to complete the structural size of the page (only elements, not styling). Each page is categorized by its primary function 
* / = basic functions, 
* /friends = pages related to friends, 
* /games = pages related to games

Pages are not styled, or even thought of in a presentational way. Instead, they are laid out structurally and how we envisioned it.
